I used third party software gimp (http://www.gimp.org/) to produce the animated gif in the vignette. 
There are some tools in R for animation, but they werenâ€™t flexible enough for what I needed. I started 
with a loop that generated the plots, but after we iterated with some aesthetics I ended up producing 
each of the plots separately and aggregating them using gimp.
 
* plotGen1.R contains the code I used to generate the plots

* testAnim1.gif is file that I posted to the web 

And the following command is imbedded into the Rmd file:
