1. Gather error handling in fitQ into a single function.
   Consider passing the main arguments to ddply_getFeatures and qFit 
   as a valided object (which therefore needs no checking).
2. Unit tests for each function, compatible with Travis build
3. Complete documentation.  Mention how orthogonal fits can be created
   with quadratic and that it will give the same result as linear.
4. Create a vignette
