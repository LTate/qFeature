1. Travis build CI tests.

2. Complete documentation.  Mention how orthogonal fits can be created
   with quadratic and that it will give the same result as linear.

3. Vignette for understanding the way arguments to fitQ behave

NOTE:  To run the tests, only this option currently works:

library(testthat)
test_package("qFeature")

Using R CMD CHECK or devtools::check("~/path_to_package/qFeature") gives an error, as described here:
https://github.com/hadley/testthat/issues/86

So, to run R CMD CHECK, we'll need to probably change the name of the tests/testthat.R file to something else so that it won't run.
