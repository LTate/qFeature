1. Construct travis build tests (use http://github.com/tesseradata/datadr) as an example

2. Add a check to more rigorously test the arguments going into fitQ() from above (e.g. fitQargs = NULL, or passing in a list, etc.)


NOTE:  To run the tests, only this option currently works:

library(testthat)
test_package("qFeature")

Using R CMD CHECK or devtools::check("~/path_to_package/qFeature") gives an error, as described here:
https://github.com/hadley/testthat/issues/86

So, to run R CMD CHECK, we'll need to probably change the name of the tests/testthat.R file to something else so that it won't run.
