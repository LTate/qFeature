1. Remove / move duplicative error chekcing in C code. Comment it out and move to check_fitQ_args()

2. Unit tests for each function, compatible with Travis build

3. Complete documentation.  Mention how orthogonal fits can be created
   with quadratic and that it will give the same result as linear.

4. Create a vignette

5.  Move make.response.mat.R and fitQslow to R, include them in tests, donâ€™t export them
